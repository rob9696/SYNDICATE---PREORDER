            <p>This is essentially what our final terms will look like, but for the pre-sale we're still finalizing things. This represents our intended structure and policies.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <p>These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your access to and use of SYNDICATE (the "Marketplace"), including our pre-launch website, where you can purchase scripts, optional audio production services, and sign up as a creator to post podcast segments. By accessing or using our services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use our services.</p>

            <p><strong>Please Note:</strong> This is a sample draft based on standard practices for online marketplaces, e-commerce sites, and content platforms. It is not legal advice, and you should consult a qualified attorney to customize and review these terms for your specific business needs.</p>

            <p>This agreement is between IronBark Productions ("We," "Us," or "Our"), and you ("You" or "User"). Our services include purchasing scripts for podcast discussions (generated using AI tools like Grok, ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini), optional audio production during pre-launch, and a Marketplace for posting and monetizing approximately 20-minute podcast segments (referred to as "Segments" or "Lessons"). By placing an order or signing up, you confirm that you are at least 18 years old or have legal capacity to enter into contracts.</p>

            <h2>2. Definitions</h2>
